This project is part of [War Brokers Projects](https://github.com/War-Brokers/War-Brokers).

## What is this?

On December 2023, Maxbros [proposed on discord][proposal_discord] a UI overhaul
of the game War Brokers along with a [video][proposal_video] of how the new UI
might look like. Project WB UI v2 is an attempt to implement the said design
with the goal of providing an interactive prototype to the players and WB
developers - which has the following benefits:

- helps players understand and more importantly, experience how much better the
  UI could be
- allows us to test and refine the design even further
- helps WB developers to easily (relatively speaking) implement this into the
  game
